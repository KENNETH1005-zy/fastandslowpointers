# Solution: Circular Array Loop
Let's solve the Circular Array Loop problem using the Fast and Slow Pointers pattern.

## Statement
There is a circular list of non-zero integers called nums. Each number in the list tells you how many steps to move forward or backward from your current position:

If nums[i] is positive, move nums[i] steps forward.

If nums[i] is negative, move nums[i] steps backward.
# Solution: Find the Duplicate Number
Let's solve the Find the Duplicate Number problem using the Fast and Slow Pointers pattern.

## Statement
Given an array of positive numbers, nums, such that the values lie in the range 
[1,n]
, inclusive, and that there are 

n+1
 numbers in the array, find and return the duplicate number present in nums. There is only one repeated number in nums, but it may appear more than once in the array.

# Solution: Palindrome Linked List
Let's solve the Palindrome Linked List problem using the Fast and Slow Pointers pattern.

## Statement
Given the head of a linked list, your task is to check whether the linked list is a palindrome or not. Return TRUE if the linked list is a palindrome; otherwise, return FALSE.
