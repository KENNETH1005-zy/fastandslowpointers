# Solution: Circular Array Loop
Let's solve the Circular Array Loop problem using the Fast and Slow Pointers pattern.

## Statement
There is a circular list of non-zero integers called nums. Each number in the list tells you how many steps to move forward or backward from your current position:

If nums[i] is positive, move nums[i] steps forward.

If nums[i] is negative, move nums[i] steps backward.
